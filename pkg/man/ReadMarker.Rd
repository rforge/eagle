\title{Read  marker data.}
\usage{
ReadMarker(filename = NULL, type = "text", missing = NULL, AA = NULL,
  AB = NULL, BB = NULL, availmemGb = 16, quiet = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{contains the name of the marker  file. The file name needs to be in quotes.}

\item{type}{specify the type of file. Choices are "text" (the default) and "PLINK".}

\item{missing}{the number or character for a missing genotype in the text file. There is no need to specify this for a PLINK ped file. Missing 
allele values in a PLINK file must be coded as "0" or "-".}

\item{AA}{the character or number corresponding to the AA snp genotype in the marker genotype file. 
This need only be specified if the file type is "text".  If a character then it must be in quotes.}

\item{AB}{the  character or number  corresponding to the AB snp genotype in the marker genotype file. 
This need only be specified if the file type is "text".
This can be left unspecified 
              if there are no heterozygous genotypes (i.e. the individuals are inbred). Only a single 
 heterozygous genotype is allowed (Eagle does not distinguish between AB and BA).  
If specified and a character, it must be in quotes.}

\item{BB}{the character or number corresponding to the BB snp genotype in the marker genotype file. 
This need only be  specified if the file type is "text".  If a character, then it must be in quotes.}

\item{availmemGb}{a numeric value. It specifies the amount of available memory (in Gigabytes). 
This should be set to be as large as possible for best performance.}

\item{quiet}{a logical value. If set to \code{TRUE}, additional runtime output is printed along with additional error checking. Specifically, 
\code{ReadMarker} will check that the marker file has the same number of column entries per row.}
}
\value{
To allow \code{\link{AM}} to handle data larger than the memory capacity of a machine, \code{ReadMarker} doesn't load 
the marker data into memory. Instead, it creates a reformatted file of the marker data and its transpose. The object returned by
\code{ReadMarker} is a list object with the elements \code{asciifileM} , \code{asciifileMt}, and \code{dim_of_ascii_M}  
which is the full file name (name and path)  of the reformatted file for the marker  data,  the full file name of the reformatted file 
for the transpose of the marker  data,  and a 2 element vector with the first element the number of individuals and the second 
element the number of marker loci.
}
\description{
A function for reading in marker data. Two types of data can be read.
}
\details{
\code{ReadMarker} can handle two different types of marker data; namely,
genotype data in a plain text file, and PLINK ped files. 
 
\subsection{\strong{Reading in a plain text file containing the marker genotypes}}{
To load a text file that contains snp genotypes, run \code{ReadMarker} with \code{filename} set to the name of the file, 
and \code{AA}, \code{AB}, \code{BB} set to the corresponding genotype values. 
The genotype values in the text file can be numeric, character, or  a mix of both.

We make the following assumptions
\itemize{
\item{The text file does not contain row or column headings}
\item{The file is allowed to contain missing genotypes that have been coded according to \code{missing}}
\item{Individuals are diploid}
\item{The rows of the text file are the individuals and the columns are the marker loci}
\item{The file is space separated}
\item{The mapping of the observed genotypes in the marker file to \code{AA}, \code{AB}, and \code{BB}, remains the same for all loci}
\item{Individuals are outbred when \code{AA}, \code{AB}, and \code{BB} are specified and 
 inbred when only \code{AA}, and \code{BB} are specified}
\item{For a text file, the same alphanumeric value is used for all missing marker genotypes. For a PLINK ped file, the missing allele is allowed to 
be "0" or "-".} 
}

For example, suppose we have a space separated text file with marker genotype data collected from five snp loci on three individuals
where the snp genotype AA has been coded 0, the snp genotype AB has been coded 1, the snp genotype BB has been coded 2, and missing genotypes are coded 
as 99
\tabular{ccccc}{
 0 \tab  1  \tab  2 \tab  0\tab   2 \cr
 1 \tab  1  \tab  0 \tab  2 \tab  0 \cr
 2 \tab  2  \tab  1 \tab  1 \tab  99
}
The file is called "geno.txt" and is located in the directory "/my/dir/". 

 
To load these data, we would use the command

\preformatted{geno_obj <- ReadMarker(filename="/my/dir/geno.txt", AA=0, AB=1, BB=2, type="text", missing=99)}

where the results from running the function are placed in \code{geno_obj}.

As another example, suppose we have a space separated text file with marker genotype data collected from five snp loci on three individuals 
where the snp genotype AA has been coded a/a, the snp genotype AB has been coded a/b, and the snp genotype BB has been coded b/b
\tabular{c}{
 a/a a/b b/b a/a b/b \cr
 a/b a/b a/a b/b a/a \cr
 b/b b/b a/b a/b NA 
}
The file is called "geno.txt" and is located in the same directory from which R is being run (i.e. the working directory). 

To load these data, we would use the command 

\preformatted{geno_obj <- ReadMarker(filename="geno.txt", AA="a/a", AB="a/b", BB="b/b", 
                                       type="text", missing = "NA")}

where the results from running the function are placed in \code{geno_obj}.
}

\subsection{\strong{Reading in a PLINK ped file}}{
PLINK is a well known toolkit for the analysis of genome-wide association data. See  
\url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2}
for details. 

Full details of PLINK ped files can be found \url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#ped}. Briefly, 
the PED file is a space delimited file (tabs are not allowed): the first six columns are mandatory:

\tabular{l}{
    Family ID  \cr
    Individual ID \cr
    Paternal ID \cr
    Maternal ID \cr
    Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown) \cr
    Phenotype
}


Here, these columns can be any values since \code{ReadMarker} ignores these columns.  

Genotypes (column 7 onwards) can be any character 
(e.g. 1,2,3,4 or A,C,G,T or anything else) except 0 which is, by default, the missing genotype character. All markers should be biallelic. 
All snps must have two alleles specified.  Missing alleles (i.e 0 or -) are allowed.
No column headings should be given. 

As an example, suppose we have data on three individuals  genotyped for four snp loci 
\tabular{cccccccccccccc}{
    FAM001 \tab 101  \tab  0    \tab 0   \tab   1  \tab 0 \tab  A  \tab  G  \tab C \tab C \tab C \tab G \tab A \tab A \cr
    FAM001 \tab 201  \tab  0    \tab 0   \tab   2  \tab 0 \tab  A  \tab  A  \tab C \tab T \tab G \tab G \tab T \tab A \cr 
    FAM001 \tab 300  \tab  101  \tab 201 \tab   2  \tab 0 \tab  G  \tab  A  \tab T \tab T \tab C \tab G \tab A \tab T 
}

Then to load these data, we would use the command 

\preformatted{geno_obj <- ReadMarker(filename="PLINK.ped", type="PLINK")}

where \code{geno_obj} is used by \code{\link{AM}}, and the file "PLINK.ped" is located in the working directory (i.e. the directory from which R 
is being run). 
}


\subsection{Reading in other formats}{
Having first installed the stand-alone PLINK software, it is possible to convert other file formats into PLINK ped files. See \url{https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats} for details. 

For example, to convert  vcf file into a PLINK ped file, at the unix prompt, use the PLINK command

\preformatted{PLINK --vcf filename.vcf --recode --out newfilename}

and to convert a binary ped file (bed) into a ped file, use the PLINK command

\preformatted{PLINK --bfile filename --recode --tab --out newfilename}
 
}

  complete.name <- system.file("extdata", "geno.txt", package="Eagle")

  # 1 values are being treated as genotype AB,

  #
  # The function system.file() gives the full file name (name + full path).
  complete.name <- system.file("extdata", "geno.ped", package="Eagle")

  # 
  # The full path and name of the file is
  print(complete.name)
  
  # Here,  the first 6 columns are being ignored and the allelic 
  # information in columns 7 -  10002 is being converted into a reformatted file. 
  # 4 gigabytes of memory has been specified. 
  # The file is space separated with the rows the individuals
  # and the columns the snp loci.
